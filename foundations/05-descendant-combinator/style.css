.container .text {
    
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
/* In this exercise the "container" contained the "text" class which indicated there would need to be a
space inbetween ".container" and ".text". Whereas in the previous lesson there need not be a space due to
both classes being in the same contained space. */
