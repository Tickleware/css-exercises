/* The beginning with the first two paragraphs was easily solved. Stated that the first paragraph was in the body
and separated it from the second paragraph with "body" type. The second paragraph I separated with the ".para"
class in front to give it the parameters it needed to have the correct font size.

The buttons were a larger issue for me. I first separated them into their own classes and then realized that the
font size was under the second set of properties for the buttons. Knowing this I then put the class types for 
both properties as "button" and then, after awhile, figured out that I could add the ".confirm" to the first set
of properties to make the "CONFIRM" button as intended in the desired outcome.

The last segment of properties gave me pause for a moment, but I was able to simple add ".text" to the first set
of properties without a space and then the desired result was achieved.*/
