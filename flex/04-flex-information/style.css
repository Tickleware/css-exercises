/* This took me a long time to figure out. My first thought was to separate the images and the text into two separate
containers which worked, except for the text was still colliding with each other. I did not think to use "max-width"
in that instance but if I had I believed it would have worked just fine, but it would have been more work than needed
to get the same result.

In the second instance, I google searched many possible solutions and got a little further in changing the html only
a little, in opposed to my first iteration, but again I was stumped at figuring out the text colliding with each other.

I, then, peeked at the solution, finding my solution completely different, I undid all changes I made and restarted from 
scratch after closing the solution. Now, with my google searches asking the correct questions, I was able to get a lot closer
than before. Similar with the last lesson, however, I forgot the existence of gap and started changing the margins of every 
single image and text box, which did not work.

I found the "max-width" option in a google search and that help with the text and then saw the README.md requesting a 52px
"gap" between each item, and then I remember the "Gap" option. Overall, very tricky and a good lesson.*/
