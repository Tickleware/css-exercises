/* I completed the assignment with some help from the Odin Project Flex path (using justify-content and align-items).
The left flex box was not tight to the left side while the right flex box was. I used margins and added the class
".left-links" to input these margins only to the left side which needed it to be tight to that side. the Logo was taking
the whole space so I added margins of 10px to have it seem like it was inside of the background color. */
