/* I completed the assignment with some help from the Odin Project Flex path (using justify-content and align-items).
The left flex box was not tight to the left side while the right flex box was. I used margins and added the class
".left-links" to input these margins only to the left side which needed it to be tight to that side. the Logo was taking
the whole space so I added margins of 10px to have it seem like it was inside of the background color. */

/* Upon looking at the solution, I found my error in that I was not aware of the "gap" function which made the left and
right side buttons simultaneously equal between all buttons and against the edges of the header and did not think of
adding padding to the header in order to make the Logo seem like it was sitting inside of the header. */
